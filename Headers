Let's take a look at another formatting convention: the header. Headers are frequently used on websites, magazine articles, and notices, to draw attention to a section. As their name implies, they act like titles or subtitles above sections.

There are six types of headers, in decreasing sizes:

This is header one
This is header two
This is header three
This is header four
This is header five
This is header six
To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want. For example, for a header one, you'd use one hash mark (# Header One), while for a header three, you'd use three (### Header Three).

It's up to you to decide when it's appropriate to use which header. In general, headers one and six should be used sparingly.

You can also mix and match inline styles within headers, such as italicizing them. In the box below, make the first line a heading level four, and italicize the name of the book:
