Markdown has several ways of formatting paragraphs.

Let's take a few lines of poetry as an example. Suppose you want to write text that looks like this:

Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)

Now, you might think that simply typing each verse onto its own line would be enough to solve the problem:

Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
Unfortunately, you'd be wrong! This Markdown would render simply as a single straight line: Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself, (I am large, I contain multitudes.).

If you forcefully insert a new line, you end up breaking the togetherness:

Do I contradict myself?

Very well then I contradict myself,

(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
This is what's known as a hard break; what our poetry asks for is a soft break. You can accomplish this by inserting two spaces after each new line. This is not possible to see, since spaces are invisible, but it'd look something like this:

Do I contradict myself?··
Very well then I contradict myself,··
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
Each dot ( · ) represents a space on the keyboard.


Aside from formatting poetry, one of the common uses for these soft breaks is in formatting paragraphs in lists. Recall in the previous lesson that we inserted a new line for multiple paragraphs within a list.

You’ve completed all the lessons!

Believe it or not, we’ve only just begun exploring what can be accomplished with Markdown. There are many “extended” implementations of Markdown that support formats like tables, definition lists, footnotes, and more. Because they’re non-standard, they’re not essential to learning the basics, as we’ve introduced here.

If you’d like to know more about these Markdown implementations, you’re welcome to explore any number of other Markdown apps and tutorials. Here are just a few:
